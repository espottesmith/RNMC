Reaction Network Monte Carlo (RNMC) is a colleciton of programs for Monte Carlo simulation of chemical systems heavily inspired by [SPPARKS](https://spparks.sandia.gov/). It currently consists of the following simulators:

- GMC: GMC is designed to run large numbers of simulations of a fixed reaction network in parallel. GMC can simulate densely connected reaction networks because it computes the reaction dependency graph dynamically and it is shared between all simulation threads.

### Dependencies

RNMC depends on [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for pseudo random number generation and [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for the database interfaces.

### Building

On a machine with system versions of GSL and sqlite, the executables can be built like this:
```
CC=g++ ./build.sh
```
The executables are put in the `build` directory. Note that the build script uses the `gsl-config` utility to find headers and libraries for GSL. If you are on a cluster and sqlite is not present, it can be built as follows:

```
cd $HOME
wget https://www.sqlite.org/2021/sqlite-amalgamation-3360000.zip
unzip sqlite-amalgamation-3360000.zip
cd sqlite-amalgamation-3360000
gcc -o libsqlite3.so -shared -fPIC sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl
```

in which case, the simulators can be built like this:

```
export CPATH=$HOME/sqlite-amalgamation-3360000:$CPATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/sqlite-amalgamation-3360000:$LIBRARY_PATH
CC=g++ ./build.sh
```

### Testing

Run the tests using `test.sh` from the root directory of the repository.

## Running GMC

GMC is run as follows:

```
GMC --reaction_database=rn.sqlite --initial_state_database=initial_state.sqlite --number_of_simulations=1000 --base_seed=1000 --thread_count=8 --step_cutoff=200 --dependency_threshold=1
```

- `reaction_database`: a sqlite database containing the reaction network and metadata.
- `initial_state_database` : a sqlite database containing initial state. The simulation trajectories are also written into the database
- `number_of_simulation`: an integer specifying how many simulations to run
- `base_seed`: seeds used are `base_seed, base_seed+1, ..., base_seed+number_of_simulations-1`
- `thread_count`: is how many threads to use.
- `step_cutoff`: how many steps in each simulation
- `dependency_threshold`: if simulations run for a long time, the dependency graph can grow quite large. We slow down its growth by only computing the dependency node corresponding to a reaction after it has been seen `dependency_threshold` times. Set to zero if you want to compute dependents on first occurrence.

### The Reaction Network Database

There should be 2 tables in the reaction network database:
```
    CREATE TABLE metadata (
            number_of_species   INTEGER NOT NULL,
            number_of_reactions INTEGER NOT NULL
    );
```
the factors can be used to modify rates of reactions which have zero or two reactants, or have duplicate reactants.

```
    CREATE TABLE reactions (
            reaction_id         INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
            number_of_reactants INTEGER NOT NULL,
            number_of_products  INTEGER NOT NULL,
            reactant_1          INTEGER NOT NULL,
            reactant_2          INTEGER NOT NULL,
            reactant_3          INTEGER NOT NULL,
            product_1           INTEGER NOT NULL,
            product_2           INTEGER NOT NULL,
            product_3           INTEGER NOT NULL,
            rate                REAL NOT NULL
    );

```
There are 3 tables in the initial state database:
```
    CREATE TABLE trajectories (
            seed         INTEGER NOT NULL,
            step         INTEGER NOT NULL,
            reaction_id  INTEGER NOT NULL,
            time         REAL NOT NULL
    );
```

```
    CREATE TABLE factors (
            factor_zero         REAL NOT NULL,
            factor_two          REAL NOT NULL,
            factor_three        REAL NOT NULL,
            factor_duplicate    REAL NOT NULL,
            factor_triple       REAL NOT NULL)
```

```
    CREATE TABLE initial_state (
            species_id             INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
            count                  INTEGER NOT NULL
    );

```
